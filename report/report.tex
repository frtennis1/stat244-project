\maketitle

We are interested in studying the statistical and computational techniques in
GLMs with high-dimensional data. We build upon the well-known lasso method for
OLS, understanding the adaptations relevant to GLMS, their computational
complexities, and their asymptotic guarantees. To this end, we compiled a list
of references which we find interesting.
